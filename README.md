CrashPlan is backup software that allows Windows, Mac, Linux and Solaris users to back up their data to an offsite data center, computers belonging to friends and family, as well as to attached drives /shared folders. There is a free version (for personal use only) and CrashPlan+ which is for both personal and business use. Both versions allow users to back up data automatically. Files are encrypted using 448-bit Blowfish encryption for CrashPlan+ and 128-bit encryption for the personal CrashPlan before transmission.
